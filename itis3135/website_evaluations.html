                    <h3> <a href="https://www.theworldsworstwebsiteever.com/">Worst Website</a></h3>
                    <p>This is the world's worst website because the site does not comply with the principles of CRAP.
                        CRAP stands for Contrast, Repetition, Alignment and Proximity.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Principles of CRAP</li>
                        <li>There are four principles when it comes to CRAP</li>
                        <li>First, it starts with C- stands for Contrast</li>
                        <li>Reading the elements in the site, the site has too many colors and hard to focus on one single element.
                        </li>
                        <li>Second, comes to R-epetition</li>
                        <li>Most of the fonts in the WebSIte are repeated throughout. Makes it a sore for eyes, and the same goes
                            for colors</li>
                        <li>Next is A-lignment</li>
                        <li>Texts, Images, Links are all linked to either side of the page, and some of the texts are half-linked.
                        </li>
                        <li>Last is Proximity</li>
                        <li>When you scroll down, there is a lot of whitespace, just scorlling down, gets bored.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3><a href="www.lowes.com">Lowe's Store</a></h3>
                    <p>Now this is a website that follows the principles of CRAP</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Principles of CRAP</li>
                        <li>There are IV principles when it comes to CRAP</li>
                        <li>First, it starts with C- stands for Contrast</li>
                        <li>Lowe's store uses blue and white mostly paying homage to their store's primary colors</li>
                        <li>In contrast, the site does not do rule-bending when it comes C in CRAP.</li>
                        <li>Second, comes to R-epetition</li>
                        <li>When it comes to Repetition, the site does not repeat elements, most of the elements are organized
                            differently, and made sure they feel new and feel something different.</li>
                        <li>Next is A-lignment</li>
                        <li>Lowes store uses tables and rows, but you cannot see rows and tables, and they are organized correctly
                            for the user</li>
                        <li>Last is Proximity</li>
                        <li>When you open the page, you can see everything is proximal range and does not veer of their course</li>
                    </ul>
