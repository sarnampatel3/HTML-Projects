    <h2>Comparing two websites</h2>
    <section>
        <h3> <a href="https://www.theworldsworstwebsiteever.com/">Worst Website</a></h3>
        <p> This is a bad website as it does not comply with the principe of CRAP. 
            CRAP stands for Contrastm Repetitiom, Alignment and Proximity.
        <ul>
            <li>Principles of CRAP</li>
            <li>There are four principles:</li>
            <li>C- Contrast</li>
            <li>Reading the elements in the site, the site has too many colors and hard to focus on one single element.
            </li>
            <li>R- Repetition</li>
            <li>Most of the fonts in the WebSIte are repeated throughout. Makes it a sore for eyes, and the same goes
                for colors</li>
            <li>A- Alignment</li>
            <li>Texts, images and inks are linked to either side of the page, and some of the texts are half-linked.
            </li>
            <li>P- Proximity</li>
            <li>When scrolled down, there is a lot of whitespace, just scrolling down, gets bored.</li>
        </ul>
        
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3><a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Good Website</a></h3>
        <p>On the other hand, this is a website that follows the principles of CRAP</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Principles of CRAP</li>
            <li>Principles when it comes to CRAP</li>
            <li>C- Contrast</li>
            <li>Lowe's store uses blue and white mostly paying homage to their store's primary colors</li>
            <li>In contrast, the site does not do rule-bending when it comes C in CRAP.</li>
            <li>R- Repetition</li>
            <li>When it comes to Repetition, the site does not repeat elements, most of the elements are organized
                differently, and made sure they feel new and feel something different.</li>
            <li>A- Alignment</li>
            <li>Lowes store uses tables and rows, but you cannot see rows and tables, and they are organized correctly
                for the user</li>
            <li>P- Proximity</li>
            <li>When you open the page, you can see everything is proximal range and does not veer of their course</li>
        </ul>
